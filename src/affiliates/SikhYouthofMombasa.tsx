                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                        Faith is at the heart of everything we do. Following the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, we practice Naam Japna. 
                        Through kirtan, the singing of hymns, we immerse ourselves in divine remembrance.

                        To truly understand and connect with our prayers, we also focus on learning Gurmukhi, the script of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. 
                        By improving our ability to read and understand Gurbani, we deepen our knowledge of Sikh teachings and keep our spiritual 
                        heritage alive.

                        Seva (selfless service) is a fundamental principle of Sikhism, and we embody Vand Chakna, sharing what we have with others. 
                        Through charity events, food drives, and community service projects, we put this teaching into action, ensuring that we support 
                        those in need and uplift our community.
